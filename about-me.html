                <p>Powerlifting is the sport of the squat, bench, and deadlift. It is a growing sport where many people look to compete against others and test their strength.</p>

                    <p>If you get a good lift, you get three white lights like this: </p>
                    <svg height="100" width="100">
                        <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="white" /> 
                    </svg> 
                    <svg height="100" width="100">
                        <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="white" /> 
                    </svg> 
                    <svg height="100" width="100">
                        <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="white" /> 
                    </svg> 
                </div>

                <div>
                    <p>If you fail a lift, you get red lights like this:</p>
                    <svg height="100" width="100">
                        <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" /> 
                    </svg> 
                    <svg height="100" width="100">
                        <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" /> 
                    </svg> 
                    <svg height="100" width="100">
                        <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" /> 
                    </svg> 
                </div>

                <p>White lights are good, and as long as 2/3 lights are white, your lift will count towards your total. Whoever has the highest total out of the 3 lifts (3 attempts each lift) wins!</p>

            <h2>ANIME</h2>
            <p>Anime is Japanese animated cartoons, usually adapted from comics called manga. I have enjoyed many series, with my favorite being One Piece.</p>

            <h6>As you can see one piece is packed with action, mystery, sadness, and great moments.</h6>

            <h2>BASKETBALL</h2>
            <p>Basketball has been my first sport and I have been playing for a long time. I enjoy wathcing all levels of basketball, including the NBA, international, college, and even just fun pickup videos on Instagram. While I mainly do powerlifting now, I still enjoy going to play pickup ball every now and then.</p>
