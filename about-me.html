            <h4>A great video example of powerlifting as a sport!</h4>

            <div>If you get a good lift, you get three white lights like this: 
                <svg height="100" width="100">
                    <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="white" /> 
                </svg> 
                <svg height="100" width="100">
                    <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="white" /> 
                </svg> 
                <svg height="100" width="100">
                    <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="white" /> 
                </svg> 

                If you fail a lift, you get red lights like this:
                <svg height="100" width="100">
                    <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" /> 
                </svg> 
                <svg height="100" width="100">
                    <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" /> 
                </svg> 
                <svg height="100" width="100">
                    <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" /> 
                </svg> 
            </div>
            <p>White lights are good, and as long as 2/3 lights are white, your lift will count towards your total. Whoever has the highest total out of the 3 lifts (3 attempts each lift) wins!</p>

        <h2><b>ANIME</b></h2>
        <p>Anime is Japanese animated cartoons, usually adapted from comics called manga. I have enjoyed many series, with my favorite being One Piece.</p>

        <h6>As you can see one piece is packed with action, mystery, sadness, and great moments.</h6>

        <h2><b>BASKETBALL</b></h2>
        <p>Basketball has been my first sport and I have been playing for a long time. I enjoy wathcing all levels of basketball, including the NBA, international, college, and even just fun pickup videos on instagram. While I mainly do powerlifting now, I still enjoy going to play pickup ball every now and then.</p>
